### Manufacturing Drawing

Let’s start with the manufacturing drawing, some GD&T.

According to following standards: 
PAOSKDPOASKD


Everything you do can be noted as a project. A production and assembly is simply one big project that is without end. A project with end is for example a facility, where you need some parts for that single project. 

If you are in a project without end, you should want to do complete documentation. Documenting every specification on its own instead of consolidating all the information on one drawing. A single drawing does not usually comprise a complicated article. Can you really express the exact material specification, paint specification and instruction, heat treatment procedure, standards, notes to manufacturing and revision information on one drawing? Notes for manufacturing and revisions might be specific to that article, but material specification, standards, paint specification and instruction and heat treatment procedures are usually not. Changes to a paint specfication for example would require changes to all drawings where that specification is expressed. Without complete documentation with specifications on its own, you bring problems into the future that requires a lot of time to fix. A **manufacturing drawing** should only specify the geometry in an endless project. 

If you are in a project with end, you still want complete documentation but there is usually little need for exact reproducability. Then consolidation of the information on one drawing is faster and does not bring as much problems into the future. 

(Note that this is only the perception from the engineering and CAD side, there is a lot more to think about with PDM and ERP systems.) 

----------------------------------------------
You might ask why I have not written out any material or treatment on the drawing. 

My opinion is this: 

If you are creating 
If you are only creating 

If you are to only create a couple of the product and have no need to document the full procedure for a manufacturing plant. The easiest way is to add these requirements to the drawing. 

Why do I not have any 
What is supposed to be the drawing? Material? You should deal with own manufactured articles as purchased articles. 

The drawing on a purchased 

In my opinion an engineering drawing’s main purpose is to communicate the geometry of the article. Material specification, surface treatment or 

an engineering drawing should only communicate geometry of the article.
