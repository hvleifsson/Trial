### Manufacturing Drawing

Below is an example of a machined part. 


Insert picture of geomerty that I drew myself, a coupling or machined part. 

**References that could be useful:**
ASME Y14.5 - Dimensioning and Tolerancing
General tolerances, for example ISO 2768 or ISO 8062

Tables with common parts and design rules from suppliers


Everything you do can be noted as a project. A production and assembly is simply one big project that is without end. A project with end is for example a facility, where you need some parts for that single project. 

If you are in a project without end, you should want to do complete documentation. Documenting every specification on its own instead of consolidating all the information on one drawing. A single drawing does not usually comprise a complicated article. Can you really express the exact material specification, paint specification and instruction, heat treatment procedure, standards, notes to manufacturing and revision information on one drawing? Notes for manufacturing and revisions might be specific to that article, but material specification, standards, paint specification and instruction and heat treatment procedures are usually not. Changes to a paint specfication for example would require changes to all drawings where that specification is expressed. Without complete documentation with specifications on its own, you bring problems into the future that requires a lot of time to fix. A **manufacturing drawing** should only specify the geometry in an endless project. 

If you are in a project with end, you still want complete documentation but there is usually little need for exact reproducability. Then consolidation of the information on one drawing is faster and does not bring as much problems into the future. 

(Note that this is only the perception from the engineering and CAD side, there is a lot more to think about with PDM and ERP systems.) 

You might ask why I have not written out any material or treatment on the drawing. This article I wrote will hopefully suffice 

My opinion is this:
