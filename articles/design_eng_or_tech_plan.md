# Design engineering or technical planning?



Design engineers and technical planners usually use different software. 

More about purpose. Take valve as example again. 
Project with end or without end? 
Facility needs both. 

What happens when this is the same person and shall work with both softwares? Both as a planner and as a design engineer? Usually it becomes a mess. 





|  | Design Engineer | Technical Planner |
|:-------------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
| CAD software | Inventor | AutoCAD |
| Common question | Manufacturable? Component strong enough? | Constructable on site? Item reachable? |
| Model | 3D | 2D (3D) |
| Data | Part number PMI (Product Manufacturing Information) | TAG number Item specific data |
