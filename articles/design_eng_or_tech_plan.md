# Design engineering or technical planning?

Design engineers create a solution to be manufactured for a problem and then communicate that solution understandably to all parties.
Technical planner put together a solution to be constructed for a problem and then communicate that solution understandably to all parties.

Both solve problems but are slightly different. In this small article I wish to clarify some differences. You might have an engineering degree but do technical planning or vice versa. I think we should focus on discussing roles instead of formal education. 

A simple traditional valve in a facilty will serve as example for this article. A design engineer created the molds and machining for the valve. A technical planner put the valve in the facility, made sure it was reachable or otherwise as good as possible with the resources available. If there was need for an unique support to uphold the piping and valve, both a technical planner and design engineer is needed. This could, and usually is, the same person. 

Let us continue to differentiate by looking at some common tools
Let's look at some different tools

Design engineers and technical planners usually use different software, have different questions in mind, have different criterias for optimal solution and usually end up working with models and data differently. See below table for a tabular comparison. 

|  | Design Engineer | Technical Planner |
|:-------------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
| CAD software | Inventor | AutoCAD |
| Common question | Manufacturable? Component strong enough? | Constructable on site? Item reachable? |
| Model | 3D | 2D (3D) |
| Natural method | Scientific | Holistic |
| Data | Part number PMI (Product Manufacturing Information) | TAG number Item specific data |

What happens when this is the same person and shall work with both softwares? Both as a planner and as a design engineer? 

Problems when roles get combined: 
* Multiple software need
* Lack of structure, everyone doing things differently
* No feedback, what went well?
* No formal specialists, long training times

In my opionon you should consider if, how often and when you are doing planning or design engineering. Some projects might be very different and sometimes more structure is not worthwile to consider. I always suggest to write and apply a company CAD practises. Document, train and discuss often. Solve problems instead of maintaining them. See <a href="https://hvleifsson.github.io/articles/cad_diff_eng_plan">What's the difference between CAD software?</a> for an explaination of different CAD software and common problems and advice.
