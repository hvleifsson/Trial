# Design engineering or technical planning?

Distances needed, placeent, maintenence distances. 

Placing a valve is different from creating a valve. Molded block and machined vs. Reachable? 

BOM contains amounts of finished products and other needed material. 


Similar to design engineering but with some difference. 
Time constraint should be higher than design engineer for example. 


Creating a solution to be manufactured or putting together an unique solution to be constructed. 

Some differances so far:

|  Common CAD tool  |        Dimension-driven, Inventor for example       |   Geometry-driven, AutoCAD for example  |
|  Common question  |       Manufacturable? Component strong enough?      | Constructable on site? Item reachable?  |
