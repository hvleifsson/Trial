# What should be on a manufacturing drawing?

XXXCan you really express the exact material specification, paint specification, paint instruction, heat treatment procedure, standards, notes to manufacturing and revision information on one single drawing? A single drawing does not usually describe a complicated part. The documentation I'm speaking of is commonly described as PMI (Product Manufacturing Information) such as material specification, paint specification, paint instruction and heat treatment procedure for example.
