# What's the difference between CAD software?

I categorize CAD software in dimension-driven or geometry-driven. In this article I'll explain the difference and recommend when you should use which. 

Example of CAD software can be seen in below table. 

|  | Dimension-driven | Geometry-driven |
|:-------------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
| CAD software | Inventor | AutoCAD |

(Planner/design engineer roles positions usually need both these softwares and it becomes hard to revise. )

Usually. There are exceptions but this is the general idea according to me. 

|  | Dimension-driven | Geometry-driven |
|:-------------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
| CAD software | Inventor | AutoCAD |
| Constraints | Local coordinates and relationships | Global coordinates |
| Quantifying | Needed items to build end product | Amount of end products |
| Model | 3D | 2D/3D |



Example 1: 
Picture of valve, BOM valve

Example 2: 
Picture of placed valves, BOM amount of valves


If you need to 

If you move a wall 1m you need to mo


Amount of valves
| CAD software | Modify relationships | Move all affected items |
